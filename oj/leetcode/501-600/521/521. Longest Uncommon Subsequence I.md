Given two strings `a` and `b`, return *the length of the **longest uncommon subsequence** between* `a` *and* `b`. *If no such uncommon subsequence exists, return* `-1`*.*

An **uncommon subsequence** between two strings is a string that is a subsequence **of exactly one of them**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** a = "aba", b = "cdc"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** One longest uncommon subsequence is "aba" because "aba" is a subsequence of "aba" but not "cdc".
Note that "cdc" is also a longest uncommon subsequence.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** a = "aaa", b = "bbb"
**Output:** 3
**Explanation:** The longest uncommon subsequences are "aaa" and "bbb".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** a = "aaa", b = "aaa"
**Output:** -1
**Explanation:** Every subsequence of string a is also a subsequence of string b. Similarly, every subsequence of string b is also a subsequence of string a. So the answer would be `-1`.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 100`
-   `a` and `b` consist of lower-case English letters.
