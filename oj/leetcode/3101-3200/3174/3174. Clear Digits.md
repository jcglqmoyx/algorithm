> 3174\. Clear Digits

---

You are given a string `s`.

Your task is to remove **all** digits by doing this operation repeatedly:

-   Delete the *first* digit and the **closest** **non-digit** character to its *left*.

Return the resulting string after removing all digits.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abc"

**Output:** "abc"

**Explanation:**

There is no digit in the string.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "cb34"

**Output:** ""

**Explanation:**

First, we apply the operation on `s[2]`, and `s` becomes `"c4"`.

Then we apply the operation on `s[1]`, and `s` becomes `""`.

**Constraints:**

-   `1 <= s.length <= 100`
-   `s` consists only of lowercase English letters and digits.
-   The input is generated such that it is possible to delete all digits.
