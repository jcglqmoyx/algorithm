You are given two strings `start` and `target`, both of length `n`. Each string consists **only** of the characters `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'_'` where:

-   The characters `'L'` and `'R'` represent pieces, where a piece `'L'` can move to the **left** only if there is a **blank** space directly to its left, and a piece `'R'` can move to the **right** only if there is a **blank** space directly to its right.
-   The character `'_'` represents a blank space that can be occupied by **any** of the `'L'` or `'R'` pieces.

Return `true` *if it is possible to obtain the string* `target` *by moving the pieces of the string* `start` ***any** number of times*. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** start = "\_L\_\_R\_\_R\_", target = "L\_\_\_\_\_\_RR"
**Output:** true
**Explanation:** We can obtain the string target from start by doing the following moves:
- Move the first piece one step to the left, start becomes equal to "**L**\_\_\_R\_\_R\_".
- Move the last piece one step to the right, start becomes equal to "L\_\_\_R\_\_\_**R**".
- Move the second piece three steps to the right, start becomes equal to "L\_\_\_\_\_\_**R**R".
Since it is possible to get the string target from start, we return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** start = "R\_L\_", target = "\_\_LR"
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** The 'R' piece in the string start can move one step to the right to obtain "\_**R**L\_".
After that, no pieces can move anymore, so it is impossible to obtain the string target from start.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** start = "\_R", target = "R\_"
**Output:** false
**Explanation:** The piece in the string start can move only to the right, so it is impossible to obtain the string target from start.

**Constraints:**

-   `n == start.length == target.length`
-   `1 <= n <= 105`
-   `start` and `target` consist of the characters `'L'`, `'R'`, and `'_'`.
